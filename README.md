# MCS51-shell

The goal of this project in 1993 was to create a GUI/Shell to make it easier to work
with Intel 8052 microprocessors. This GUI was making use of "hva_win", another project.

Now, in 2017, I would handle it completely differnt, but back in 1993, where Windows 3.1 was just introduced,
there was no flexible GUI development environment available, and had to be written from scratch.

Oh, and as a bonus, 51_dis.c is a 8052 disassembler, written in C.
